# Forensic Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on applying open-source tools for potential forensic analysis. The task involves simulating the actions of a user whose data storage has been secured as part of a legal process. 

The main steps include:

`1` Setting up a virtual environment.

`2` Simulating normal system usage, including:
   - System setting changes (registry, firewall, etc.)
   - Installing software, downloading files, and creating text documents
   - Using a web browser and deleting files
   
`3` Converting the virtual disk to a raw format.

`4` Using **Autopsy** to analyze the colleague's system image.

`5` Documenting the findings as a report.

System activity was to be generated consistently over the course of the entire semester.
